# Deep Learning with TensorFlow

A collection of hands-on projects and explorations in **deep learning**, implemented with **TensorFlow** and presented in interactive **Jupyter notebooks**.
This repository demonstrates practical applications of neural networks, from foundational models to more advanced architectures, highlighting both technical implementation and clear explanation.

## üìö What You‚Äôll Find Here

Each notebook is self-contained and designed to walk through a specific deep learning concept or use case. Topics include:

* **Fundamentals**

  * TensorFlow basics
  * Building blocks of neural networks
  * Training workflows and optimization

* **Computer Vision**

  * Image classification with CNNs
  * Data augmentation and transfer learning
  * Object detection and segmentation (future)

* **Natural Language Processing**

  * Text preprocessing and embeddings
  * RNNs, LSTMs, and attention mechanisms
  * Transformer-based models

* **Generative Models**

  * Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
  * Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

* **Applied Projects**

  * Real-world datasets
  * End-to-end pipelines
  * Model evaluation and interpretability

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone this repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deep-learning-tensorflow.git
   cd deep-learning-tensorflow
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment & install dependencies:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # on macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate      # on Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter Lab:

   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```

4. Open any notebook and start exploring.

## üìà Goals

This repo is a living, evolving collection that:

* Demonstrates practical use of TensorFlow in diverse problem domains.
* Explains concepts in a way that is both technical and accessible.
* Serves as a foundation for deeper research and experimentation.



Would you like me to make this more **academic/research flavored** (emphasizing rigor, citations, and experiments) or more **industry/career flavored** (emphasizing practical skills and applied projects)?
